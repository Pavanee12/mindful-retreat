# mindful-retreat

Mindful retreat is a digital platform offered for users where they can find places offering relaxations and mindfulness.

here yoga-retreat owners can add their own yoga camps providing all necessary information including images 
also end users can even add their reviews to the existing camps if they have attended that before. 

here I developed the front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the back end with Node.js and Express.js, and the database management with MongoDB. 
Throughout the development process, I encountered technical issues that required meticulous problem-solving. 

My first aim was to provide customers with a flawless navigating experience. I also put strong authentication protocols in place to safeguard their security and privacy.
